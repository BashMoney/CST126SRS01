Instructions:  

Write a strtrim function using the provided interface that trims the whitespace off the front and back of any null terminated cstring. 
Must work on all strings including but not limited to nullptr, empty strings, and blank strings. 

The function must work with heap allocated strings. 

The return must be identical to the input parameter. 

Be sure your function passes the provided test cases. 

Your strtrim function may only use methods found in the following headers:

You may use the cstring header, but only if you pay very close attention to the updated book Errata for page 435.
